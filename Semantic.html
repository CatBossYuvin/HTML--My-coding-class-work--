                <h2>Facts about Trains</h2>
                <p>
                    Trains, especially modern freight and passenger trains, are significant for their environmental efficiency, data
                    processing capabilities, and sheer size. They are a major mode of transportation, particularly for freight, with a
                    global network of tracks stretching to the moon and back almost twice. The world's fastest train is a maglev train,
                    reaching speeds of up to 375 mph, while the heaviest train weighs over 99,000 tons

                Trains, a common and efficient mode of transportation, move passengers and freight across vast distances. They run on
                tracks, often consisting of two parallel steel rails, and can be powered by steam, diesel, or electricity.
