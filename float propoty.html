    <h1>cats</h1>
    <p id="example">
    Cats are small, furry animals with soft fur, pointy ears, and a long tail. They have whiskers on their face and sharp
    claws on their paws. Cats are known for being playful, curious, and sometimes sleepy! They come in many colors and
    patterns, like black, white, orange, or even mixed like calico or tabby. Cats are also known for being good at jumping,
    climbing, and always landing on their feet!
